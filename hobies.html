        <div class="hobies" style="margin-left:3cm">My hobby is started with 2 megapixel camera and it gets enhanced year by year. over the years I started taking interest in it. my some samples are in the following link. when I went into college I have chosen the fine arts club. from there I went for the Rangoli making competition, which was an AKTU zonal cultural event. I was the runner up there. yep, I have little interest in fine arts also.</div>
