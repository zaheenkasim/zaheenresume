        <div style="background: seashell">An increased population growth rate leads to create traffic congestions. This have been a
                serious problem faced by almost all areas worldwide, affecting an environmental,
                economic and ecological sectors. Conventional traffic system could not evaluate gigantic
                traffic concentration in very effective modus, also it is time consuming system where
                waiting time is identical for unlike masses. Last few Decades the traffic management itâ€™s
                the vital issues in big cities. With the help of Internet of Things(IoT) we can improve the
                traffic efficiency. In this we can manage the traffic signals by monitoring the traffic
                density to avoid traffic congestion on road using network communication between server
                and hardware module. The traffic awareness it is most key problem now days. Basically
                
                the architecture is divided into modules such as wireless sensor network, RFID, GSM-
                GPS.
                
                Sometimes, it is very difficult to find a suitable parking place in parking lot. We
                have proposed a suitable solution to this problem. Arduino has already made a huge
                impact on learning. The widespread acceptance gave the open source hardware a new life,
                potentially challenging many industrial products and new interests in hardware
                prototyping and electronics. Looking at this actionable advancement towards Arduino,
                allured us to make systematic and organized parking system for vehicles, using Arduino</div>
